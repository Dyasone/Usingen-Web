        <h1>Usingen</h1>
        <p>
            Usingen lies on the Usa River in the Usinger Becken at the north-eastern edge of
            the Taunus.
            It is located about 30 km north of Frankfurt am Main, 27 km south of Wetzlar
            and 38 km northeast of Wiesbaden, putting it on the edge of the
            Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region.
            The town core is about 300 m above sea level.
            The highest elevation in the main town of Usingen is the
            Hohe Berg ("High Mountain"), 414 m above sea level.

                Usingen (Latin Osinga), which in Frankish times likely existed as a fortified
                stopping place at an old crossroads, was first mentioned in the Codex Eberhardi,
                a manuscript from the Fulda monastery, and it is generally accepted that references
                made to the town go back to between 754 and 802.

                    Archaeological proof of a settlement on the modern town's site back in
                    Carolingian times has yet to be unearthed, although, not far from town,
                    the remains of a Carolingian courtyard were once dug up.
                    The possibility therefore exists that today's Usingen might not lie on
                    the same spot as it once did, having relocated at some time in the past.
                    More investigation will be needed before this is ascertained.</span>

                In the middle of downtown Usingen is Usingen's stately home, the Usinger Schloss.
                The home's exact origins have yet to be fully explained.
                <span id="dots1">...</span>
                <span id="more1"> It is assumed that it was built in the 14th century as a castle
                    under Johann I of Nassau-Weilburg.
                    Prince Walrad had a new stately home built on the castle's site in 1660–1663.
                    The architect Friedrich Joachim Stengel (1694–1787) remodelled the Usinger Schloss
                    into a Baroque residence between 1733 and 1738 as instructed by Princess Charlotte
                    Amalie, Prince Wilhelm Heinrich I's widow.
                    In 1873, a great fire destroyed the Schloss, which was afterwards built anew.
                    Today it is used as a Gymnasium (Christian-Wirth-Schule).
                    Bordering right on the Schloss is the Usinger Schlossgarten, the stately home garden. </span>

                Another great fire in 1692 destroyed the so-called Usinger Oberstadt (Upper Town).
                The overlord at that time, Prince Walrad (1635–1702) gave orders for its prompt
                reconstruction.
                <span id="dots2">...</span>
                <span id="more2"> Symmetrical rows of houses, which still form the townscape now,
                    were built, and along the Obergasse (Upper Lane) appeared representative buildings.
                    The so-called New Town's heart was shaped by the Hugenottenkirche with
                    what is nowadays the old marketplace.
                    Benedikt Burtscher was the building master of the church, built in 1700 and
                    showing in its building style certain commonalities with the well known
                    church at La Rochelle.
                    After the Huguenot church fell out of use with the union of the
                    Lutheran Protestants and the Reformed Church,
                    it was soon converted into a school.
                    Today, however, it houses the Usingen library.
                    On the upper floors are found many places where concerts and gatherings
                    can be accommodated.
                    The wedding room is a favourite place for couples to plight their troth.</span><button

                The Hattsteinweiher near Usingen is the only bathing lake in the Usinger Land.
                In summer, when the weather is good, it is the centre of attraction for many
                visitors from the Taunus and the Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region.

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Buchfinkenstadt</h3>
        <p>
            Usingen is also known as the chaffinch city in the Buchfinkenland.
            <span id="dots3">... </span>
            <span id="more3">
                The chaffinch song written in 1938 by Theo Geisel describes the concept of home,
                the Usinger Land in the Hintertaunus, the chaffinch country.
                The song conveys security, human closeness and warmth.
                The term "chaffinch fall", the "chaffinch fair" and the book prize
                "Usinger chaffinch" have brought the term back into the consciousness
                of the citizens.
                Since the jubilee year 2002 of the city of Usingen
                colorful chaffinches beautify the cityscape at various points in the city.
